- [ ] Use Argon2id with appropriate cost factors
- [ ] Implement account takeover protection
- [ ] Use magic links over password resets
- [ ] Monitor for credential stuffing attacks

### 8. CI/CD & Software Supply Chain Security
- [ ] Use SLSA framework for supply chain security

- [ ] Use GitHub Advanced Security or GitLab Security
- [ ] Implement SAST/DAST in CI pipeline
- [ ] Use Sigstore for artifact signing
- [ ] Implement build provenance and attestation
- [ ] Use ephemeral build environments
- [ ] Implement dependency review actions
- [ ] Use OpenSSF Scorecards

### 9. Observability & Threat Detection

- [ ] Use AI-powered anomaly detection
- [ ] Implement incident response automation
- [ ] Use threat intelligence feeds

### 10. SSRF, CSRF & Modern Web Vulnerabilities
- [ ] Validate and sanitize all URLs
- [ ] Use allowlists for URL schemes, ports, and destinations
- [ ] Disable HTTP redirections
- [ ] Don't send raw responses to clients
- [ ] Use network segmentation
- [ ] Block requests to private IP ranges (10.x, 172.x, 192.168.x, 169.254.x)
